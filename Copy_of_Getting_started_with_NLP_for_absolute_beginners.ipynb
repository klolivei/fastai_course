        "One area where deep learning has dramatically improved in the last couple of years is natural language processing (NLP). Computers can now generate text, translate automatically from one language to another, analyze comments, label words in sentences, and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps the most widely practically useful application of NLP is *classification* -- that is, classifying a document automatically into some category. This can be used, for instance, for:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sentiment analysis (e.g are people saying *positive* or *negative* things about your product)\n",
        "- Author identification (what author most likely wrote some document)\n",
        "- Legal discovery (which documents are in scope for a trial)\n",
        "- Organizing documents by topic\n",
        "- Triaging inbound emails\n",
        "- ...and much more!\n",
        "\n",
        "Classification models can also be used to solve problems that are not, at first, obviously appropriate. For instance, consider the Kaggle [U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/) competition. In this, we are tasked with comparing two words or short phrases, and scoring them based on whether they're similar or not, based on which patent class they were used in. With a score of `1` it is considered that the two inputs have identical meaning, and `0` means they have totally different meaning. For instance, *abatement* and *eliminating process* have a score of `0.5`, meaning they're somewhat similar, but not identical.\n",
        "\n",
        "It turns out that this can be represented as a classification problem. How? By representing the question like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "> For the following text...: \"TEXT1: abatement; TEXT2: eliminating process\" ...chose a category of meaning similarity: \"Different; Similar; Identical\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we'll see how to solve the Patent Phrase Matching problem by treating it as a classification task, by representing it in a very similar way to that shown above."

        "When we're training a model, there will be one or more *metrics* that we're interested in maximising or minimising. These are the measurements that should, hopefully, represent how well our model will works for us.\n",

        "In real life, outside of Kaggle, things not easy... As my partner Dr Rachel Thomas notes in [The problem with metrics is a big problem for AI](https://www.fast.ai/2019/09/24/metrics/):\n",
        "\n",
        ">  At their heart, what most current AI approaches do is to optimize metrics. The practice of optimizing metrics is not new nor unique to AI, yet AI can be particularly efficient (even too efficient!) at doing so. This is important to understand, because any risks of optimizing metrics are heightened by AI. While metrics can be useful in their proper place, there are harms when they are unthinkingly applied. Some of the scariest instances of algorithms run amok all result from over-emphasizing metrics. We have to understand this dynamic in order to understand the urgent risks we are facing due to misuse of AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Kaggle, however, it's very straightforward to know what metric to use: Kaggle will tell you! According to this competition's [evaluation page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/overview/evaluation), \"*submissions are evaluated on the [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) between the predicted and actual similarity scores*.\" This coefficient is usually abbreviated using the single letter *r*. It is the most widely used measure of the degree of relationship between two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "r can vary between `-1`, which means perfect inverse correlation, and `+1`, which means perfect positive correlation. The mathematical formula for it is much less important than getting a good intuition for what the different values look like. To start to get that intuition, let's look at some examples using the [California Housing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset) dataset, which shows \"*is the median house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars*\". This dataset is provided by the excellent [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library, which is the most widely used library for machine learning outside of deep learning."
